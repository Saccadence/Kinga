### Setup
This game utilizes all cards of a 52-card deck, including the Jokers. Each suit will be organized into separate suits, with the Ace on top and the King on bottom.
Remove the Ace and 2 (the 2 top cards on each stack) and combine them with the Jokers to make up your starting playing hand.
### Objective
Dwindle all the stacks down to just the Kings without them all raising suspicion before you do so.
